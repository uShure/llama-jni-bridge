# ðŸ”§ Compilation Error Fix

## Problem
When compiling on macOS (or other systems), the following error occurred:
```
error: member access into incomplete type 'LlamaContextData'
```

## Root Cause
The struct `LlamaContextData` was forward declared at line 20:
```cpp
struct LlamaContextData;
```

But it was being used in `JNI_OnUnload` function before its full definition, causing the compiler to not know about the struct members.

## Solution
Moved the full struct definition from line 46 to line 18 (before `JNI_OnLoad` and `JNI_OnUnload` functions):

```cpp
// --- Context Data Structure ---

struct LlamaContextData {
    llama_model * model = nullptr;
    llama_context * ctx = nullptr;
    llama_sampler * sampler = nullptr;
    common_params params;
    int n_ctx = 0;
};

// --- Globals for safe resource management ---
static std::mutex g_context_registry_mutex;
static std::unordered_set<LlamaContextData*> g_active_contexts;
```

## Impact
- âœ… Fixes compilation error
- âœ… No functional changes
- âœ… Maintains all safety features (JNI lifecycle hooks, context registry, etc.)

## Testing
After applying this fix, the project should compile successfully:
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_METAL=ON
cmake --build build -j 8
```

## Related Features
As you correctly noted, the implementation includes:
1. **JNI_OnLoad/JNI_OnUnload**: Properly manages library lifecycle
2. **Context Registry**: Keeps track of valid pointers
3. **is_valid_context()**: Validates pointers before use
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: JNI_OnUnload cleans up forgotten contexts
5. **Thread Safety**: Mutex protection for context registry

This ensures safe memory management even if the JVM calls unload unexpectedly.
